Solidus Asset Variant Options
=============================

Adds the ability for admins to use the same image asset for multiple variants.
Originally a fork of [jpdesigndev/spree_asset_variant_options](https://github.com/jpdesigndev/spree_asset_variant_options).

Installation
------------

Add solidus_asset_variant_options to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "solidus_asset_variant_options"
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_asset_variant_options:install
```

Testing
-------

Until Solidus is publicly available, the easiest way to satisfy the Solidus
dependancy is with a local Bundler override:

```shell
bundle config local.spree /path/to/local/solidus/repository
```

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to
building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy
app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require "spree_asset_variant_options/factories"
```
